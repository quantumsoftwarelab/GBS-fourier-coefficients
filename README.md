# Fourier coefficients in Gaussian Boson Sampling

Simulations of ideal and noisy Gaussian Boson Sampling with StrawberryFields and Fourier coefficient computer for these systems.

This code implements the process of calculating probabilties of outcome bitstrings in GBS with threshold detectors using the Fourier series expressions of the probabilities. The Fourier coefficients are obtained with an expression derived in [this paper](https://github.com/juliammikk/report-repository/blob/main/honours-disseration.pdf) and can be calculated with a classical advantage for some amounts of loss and squeezing by truncating the summation.
